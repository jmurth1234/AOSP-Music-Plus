# AOSP Music+

Dump of the last version of the source code of AOSP Music+ 

As I never used source control for this project, all we have is an initial commit.

This project is based off the [AOSP stock music app](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_packages_apps_music), ported to work in Android Studio and with added features such as:

 - Lockscreen / notification music controls
 - Slightly refreshed now playing screen
 
This app is no longer maintained, however is uploaded here for backup
